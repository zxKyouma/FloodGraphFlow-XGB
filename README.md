## Model Training

## Inference

## Approach

We use a **graph-aware stacked XGBoost pipeline** rather than a single end-to-end sequence model.

Flood behavior in this task is **not purely local**: each node depends on *upstream inflow*, *downstream blockage*, *storage*, and *boundary conditions*. A single flat regressor struggled to represent these different hydraulic regimes.

By combining **graph-derived features**, **physics-inspired hydraulic proxy features**, **auxiliary flow surrogates (`qnet`, `qin`, `qout`)**, and a **two-stage regime-aware predictor**, the model captures propagation, retention, and delayed drainage more reliably than local rainfall and water-level features alone.

### Model Overview

At a high level, the model works in **four stages**.

**Stage 1 — Graph-aware feature construction**

We build node-level temporal features from rainfall, water level, and static network attributes, then augment them with **graph features**, **boundary indicators**, and **mass-deficit storage proxies** that encode coarse hydraulic structure.

**Stage 2 — Auxiliary flow prediction**

We train **Stage-A models** to predict latent hydraulic quantities such as **net flow**, **inflow**, and **outflow**. Their **out-of-fold predictions** are fed back into the feature set.

**Stage 3 — Regime-aware prediction**

A **two-stage XGBoost predictor** combines **regime classification** with **conditional regression**, allowing the model to treat calm, rising, and storage-dominated states differently.

**Stage 4 — Final submission assembly**

The full pipeline is trained separately for **`Model_1`** and **`Model_2`**, and their predictions are merged into the final submission.
